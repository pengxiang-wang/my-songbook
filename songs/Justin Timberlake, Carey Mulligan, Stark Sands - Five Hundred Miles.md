### Intro

                          
1. If you `C`missed the train I'm `Am`on                
You will `Dm`know that I am `F`gone              
You can `Dm`hear the whistle `Gsus2`blow a hundred `C`miles
 
                                  
> A hundred `C`miles, a hundred `Am`miles,
> A hundred `Dm`miles, a hundred `F`miles
> You can `Dm`hear the whistle `Gsus2`blow a hundred `C`miles
 

2. Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two,
Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four                         
Lord, I'm `Dm`five hundred miles away from `Gsus2`home
 
>> Away from home, away from home,

### Instrumental


3. Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go back home this a-way


>>> This a-way, this a-way,
>>> This a-way, this a-way,
>>> Lord, I can't go back home this this a-way
 
4. If you missed the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
