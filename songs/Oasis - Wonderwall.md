### Intro

`Am7` `C` `Gsus4` `D7sus4`

1. Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
And by now, you should've somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now `F9` `Gsus4` `D7sus4`

2. And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now `Am7` `C` `Gsus4` `D7sus4`
