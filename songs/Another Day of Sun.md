### Intro

`Fmaj7` `G7` `Am7` `Em7`
`Dm7` `G` `C` `Em` `Am9`

1. I `Dm7`think about that day, I `G13`left him at a Greyhound station
`Cmaj7`West of Santa FÃ©, `A7`We were seventeen, `A7b9`but he was
`Dm9`sweet and it was true, Still `G13`I did what I had to do
`Cmaj7` `C7` 'Cause `Am7`I just `A7b9`knew

2. Summer Sunday nights, We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights, A Technicolor world made out of music and machine, It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

### Pre-Ch.
With`Dm7`out a nickel to my name, `G7`Hopped a bus, here I came
`Am`Could be brave or just insane, `F`We'll have to `E7`see
'Cause `Dm7`maybe in that sleepy town, He'll `G7`sit one day, the lights are down
He'll `Csus4`see my face and `C`think of how he `E7`used to know me

> `F`Climb these hills I'm `G9`reaching for the `Cmaj7`heights, and `Dm7`chasing all the `G7sus4`lights that `Cmaj7`shine
And `Am`when they let you `G7`down (it's another day of)
You'll `Am`get up off the `G7`ground (it's another day of)
'Cause `Am`morning rolls `G7`around
And it's another day of `Cmaj7`sun`C6` `E7`

3. I hear 'em every day, The rhythms in the canyons
That'll never fade away, The ballads in the barrooms
Left by those who came before, They say "you gotta want it more"
So I bang on every door

### Pre-Ch.
And even when the answer's "no", Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow, Are all I need
And someday as I sing my song, A small-town kid'll come along
That'll be the thing to push him on and go, go

And when they let you `G7`down
The `C6`morning rolls `G7`around

### Outro
It's another day of `Fmaj7`sun (oh)
`G13`It's another day of `Am`sun (oh)
`G13`It's another day of `Fmaj7`sun (sun, sun, sun, sun)
`G13`It's just another day of `Am7`sun (oh)
`G13`Just another day of `Fmaj7`sun (oh)
`G13`It's another day of `Am`sun (sun)
`G13`Another day has just `Fmaj7`begun (oh)`G13`
It's another day of sun

`F` `G7` `Am` `F` `Em`
`F` `G7` `Am` `F` `E7`

`G7`It's another day of `Cmaj7`sun
