### Intro
`C`

            
1. `C`Almost Heaven, `Am`West Virginia, `G`Blue Ridge Mountains, `F`Shenandoah `C`River.
  Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.
 

> Country `C`Roads, take me `G`home, to the `Am`place I be`F`long
> West Vir`C`ginia, mountain `G`mama, take me `F`home, country `C`roads.
 

2.  All my memories  gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
  Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

### Bridge
`Am`I hear her `G/B`voice, in the `C`mornin' hour she calls me.                
The `F`radio re`C`minds me of my `G`home far away.
And `Am`drivin' down the `Bb`road I get a `F`feelin' that I `C`should have been home           
`G`yesterday, yester`G7`day.

### Outro
Take me `G7`home, (down) country `C`roads.
Take me `G7`home, (down) country `C`roads.
