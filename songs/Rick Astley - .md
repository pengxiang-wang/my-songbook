### Intro
`F` `G` `Em` `Am`

1. `F`We're no strangers to `G`love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

> Never gonna `F`give you `G`up, Never gonna `Em`let you `Am`down
> Never gonna `F`run around`G` and de`E`sert you`Am`
> Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye
> Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you


2. We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
