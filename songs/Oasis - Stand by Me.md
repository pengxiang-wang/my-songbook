### Intro

1. `C`Made a meal and threw it `E7`up on Sunday, `F`I've got a `F/E`lot of things to `G`learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day, before my heart starts to burn

### Pre-Ch.
`F`So what's the matter with `G`you?
`C`Sing me some`G/B`thing `Am`new
Don't you know the `D`cold and wind and rain don't know
They `F`only seem to come and go `G`away

2. Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door

（重复 Pre-Ch.）

> `C`Stand by `G`me, nobody `Dm`knows the way it's gonna `F`be `Bb` `G` `C`
> Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
> Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
> Stand by me, nobody `Dm`knows
Yeah, nobody `F`knows, `G`the way it's gonna `C`be

3. If you're leaving will you take me with you?
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home

（重复 Pre-Ch.）

### Bridge
The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away (hey, hey)
