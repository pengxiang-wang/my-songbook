1. `C`You got the invi`C6`tation, `C`You got the right address
You need some medication? The answer's always yes
`Dm7`A little chance en`Dm9`counter, `Dm7`Could be the one you've `Cmaj7`waited for
Just `C6`squeeze a bit more
2. Tonight we're on a mission, Tonight's the casting call
If this is the real audition, Oh, God, help us all
You make the right impression, Then everybody knows your name
We're in the fast lane


> `Fmaj7`Someone in the `G7`crowd could be the `Cmaj7`one you need to `A7`know
> The one to finally lift you off the ground
> Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
> If `Fmaj7`you're the someone `G7`ready to be `Am7`found (you're the someone ready to be found)

### Pre-Ch.
Do what you `Am7`need to do, 'Til they dis`Fmaj7`cover you
And make you `G7`more than who, You're seeing `C6`now `E7`

You've got to `G7`go and find (That someone in the crowd)
