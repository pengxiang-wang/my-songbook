### Intro

`C` `F` `C` `F`


1. `C`Slip inside the `G`eye of your `Am`mind, don't you `E`know you might `F`find,`G` a better place to `C`play `Am` `G`
You said that you'd never been, but all the things that you've seen, slowly fade away

### Pre-Ch.
`F`So I start a revo`Fm`lution from my`C` bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
`G`Stand up beside the fireplace
`E7/G#`Take that look from off your face
`Am`You ain't ever `G`gonna burn my `F`heart out`G`


> And so Sally can wait, she knows it's too late, as we're walking on by
> Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger, I heard you say

2. Take me to the place where you go, where nobody knows, if it's night or day
But please don't put your life in the hands, of a rock and roll band, who'll throw it all away

### Pre-Ch.
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
