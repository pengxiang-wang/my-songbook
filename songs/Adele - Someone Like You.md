### Intro

`C` `Em/B` `Am` `F`

1. `C`I heard that you're `Em/B`settled down
That you `Am`found a girl and you're `F`married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light


### Pre-Ch.

`G9`I hate to turn up out of the `Am`blue, uninvited
But I`F` couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd `G9`hoped you'd see my face
And `Am`that you'd be reminded that for `F`me, it isn't `Fmaj7`over





> `C`Never mind, I'll `G`find someone like `Am`you `F`
> I wish nothing but the best for you, too
> "Don't forget me, " I beg, I remember you said
> "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
> "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"



2. You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

### Bridge
`G`Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Re`Am`grets and mistakes, they're memories made
`F`Who would have known how bitter`Dm`sweet `C`this would `F`taste? `G`
