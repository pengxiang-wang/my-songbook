1. `C`When the rain is blowing `G/B`in your face,`Bb` and the whole world is `F`on your case
`Fm`I could offer you a `C`warm embrace, `D` to make you `G`feel my `C`love

2. When the evening shadows and the stars appear, and there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years, to make you feel my love

> `F`I know you haven't made your `C`mind up yet, `E7`but I will `F`never do you `C`wrong
> `F`I've known it from the moment `C`that we met, `Dm`no doubt in my mind where you `G`belong

3. I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue, I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

### Instrumental


> The storms are raging on the rolling sea, and on the highway of regret
> The winds of change are blowing wild and free, you ain't seen nothing like me yet

4. I could make you happy, make your dreams come true, othing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you, to make you feel my love

### Outro
To make you feel my love
