### Intro

1. Hello darkness my old friend, I come to talk with you again
   Because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping
   And a vision that was planted in my brain, still remains
   Within the sound of silence

2. In restless dreams I walk alone narrow streets of cobblestone
   'Neath the halo of a streetlamp, I turn my collar to the cold and damp
   When my eyes were stabbed by flash of a neon light that split the night
   And touch the sound of silence

3. And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people, maybe more
   People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
   People writing songs that voices never share, and no one dared
   Disturb the sound of silence

4. "Fools", said I, "you do not know, silence like a cancer grows
   Hear my word that I might teach you, take my arms that I might reach you"
   But my words like silent raindrops fell
   And echoed in the wells of silence

5. And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made
   And the sign flashed out its warning in the word that it was forming
   And the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
   And whispered in the sound of silence
