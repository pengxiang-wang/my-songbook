### Intro

1. Just a perfect day, drink Sangria in the park
   And then later, when it gets dark, we go home

2. Just a perfect day, feed animals in the zoo
   Then later a movie too, and then home

> Oh, it's such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you
> Oh, such a perfect day, you just keep me hanging on
> You just keep me hanging on

3. Just a perfect day, problems all left alone
   Weekenders on our own, it's such fun

4. Just a perfect day, you made me forget myself
   I thought I was someone else, someone good

### About Lyrics
这首歌讲述了 Lou Reed 和女友 Bettye Kronstad 在纽约中央公园美好的一天，歌曲深沉但美好，原本表达的意思也很简单。但是很多人理解此歌曲表达的是和毒品海洛因度过的美好一天，在浪漫化吸毒，歌曲也因此成为关于吸毒者生活的电影《猜火车》的经典配乐。不过 Lou Reed 本人一直否认对歌曲的这种解读。
