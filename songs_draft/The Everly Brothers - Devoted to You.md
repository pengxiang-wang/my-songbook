1. Darlin', you can count on me, till the sun dries up the sea
   Until then I always be devoted to you

2. I'll be yours through endless time, I'll adore your charms sublime
   Guess by now you know that I'm devoted to you

> I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie, I'll never be untrue
> I'll never give you reason to cry, I'd be unhappy if you were blue

3. Through the years my love will grow, like a river it will flow
   It can't die because I'm so devoted to you
